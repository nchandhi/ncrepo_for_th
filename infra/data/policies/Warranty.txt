Warranty & FAQs Product Warranty 🛡️

Warranty Coverage

- Contoso Paints are backed by a 2-year performance warranty covering tint accuracy, film integrity, and nanocoating defects.

- This warranty ensures your walls resist premature fading, peeling, or coating failure under normal use.

FAQs

- How does nanocoating improve paint?
Nanocoating builds microscopic layers that repel stains, resist scuffs, and improve washability. It also helps paint “self-heal” minor surface abrasions.

- How much coverage do I get per gallon?
On average, 1 gallon covers 350–400 sq ft in a single coat. Thanks to our optimized pigment dispersion, many projects require fewer coats compared to standard paints.

- Are your paints eco-friendly?
Yes. Our eco-tech line is certified low-VOC and manufactured in facilities powered by renewable energy. Cans are recyclable, and formulas are compliant with strict indoor air quality standards.

- Do you offer color matching?
Yes. Our AI-powered color scanner can match textiles, photos, or competitor swatches with 95%+ accuracy. You’ll see a digital preview before final tinting.

- How durable is Contoso Paint?
Our fade-shield technology resists UV light degradation, keeping colors vivid even in bright, sunlit spaces. High-traffic areas benefit from extra abrasion resistance in our Pro line.

- Can your paints be used outdoors?
Yes — our ExteriorGuard series is weather-rated, with hydrophobic barriers that repel rain, protect against mildew, and expand/contract with temperature shifts to avoid cracking.

- Do I need primer?
Most surfaces benefit from primer for best adhesion. However, our 2-in-1 self-priming formulas bond directly to drywall, plaster, or pre-painted walls, cutting down on prep time.

- What if my paint arrives damaged?
Contact us within 7 days. We’ll replace or refund any shipment with leaking cans, damaged seals, or color mismatch.

- Can I recycle leftover paint?
Yes. We partner with regional eco-drop centers to recycle both cans and unused product. Ask support for your nearest facility.
